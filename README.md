# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-Using-OpenCV
This project uses OpenCV and Keras for Facial Emotion Recognition with the FER-2013 dataset. It preprocesses images, trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and employs data augmentation for robustness. Performance is evaluated through accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.
